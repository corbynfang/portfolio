TTL: Automatic (or 3600)
```

#### Option B: Using CNAME (if Railway provides it)

```
Type: CNAME
Host: @
Value: yourproject.up.railway.app
TTL: Automatic (or 3600)
```

#### For WWW Subdomain (Optional)

```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: corbyn.dev (or yourproject.up.railway.app)
TTL: Automatic (or 3600)
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Part 3: Wait for DNS Propagation

- **DNS changes take time**: 5 minutes to 48 hours
- **Usually propagates in**: 15-30 minutes
- **Check status**: https://dnschecker.org/#A/corbyn.dev

---

## ‚úÖ Part 4: Verify Setup

### Test Your Domain

1. Wait 15-30 minutes after adding DNS records
2. Visit: `https://corbyn.dev`
3. Visit: `https://www.corbyn.dev` (if you set it up)

### Check in Railway

In Railway dashboard:
- Your domain should show a **green checkmark** ‚úÖ
- Status should say **"Active"**

---

## üîí Part 5: SSL/HTTPS

Railway **automatically** provides free SSL certificates:
- Uses Let's Encrypt
- Auto-renews
- HTTPS enabled by default

Your site will be accessible at:
- ‚úÖ `https://corbyn.dev`
- ‚úÖ `https://www.corbyn.dev` (if configured)

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Domain not working after 30 minutes?

1. **Check DNS records** are correct in your registrar
2. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Test DNS propagation**: https://dnschecker.org
4. **Check Railway logs** for errors
5. **Verify domain status** in Railway dashboard

### Common Issues

**"DNS not found"**
- DNS records not added correctly
- Wait longer for propagation

**"SSL Certificate Pending"**
- Normal! Railway is generating your certificate
- Can take 10-15 minutes

**"Domain already in use"**
- Remove domain from Railway
- Re-add it
- Make sure DNS points to correct Railway project
